Odd Duck Products project for Code Fellows, 201.

## Odd Duck Product

The user will be shown various product images at a time and should click on which image they prefer out of the set. When the user clicks on an image, a new set of images will load and the user will repeat the process until they complete the survey. This project will track how many times each product is shown on the screen as well as how many times a product is clicked on. When the survey is completed, click on "View Results" to get a break down of the information gathered displayed as a bar chart using Chart.js

**IMPORTANT** The clicks & show count will only be saved/recorded when the survey is finished and when the user clicks "View Results".

This project is meant to demonstrate an understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and implements constructor functions, forms, event handlers, local storage.


## Timeline
- Day 1 - Focusing on implementing constructors to create 'products' and the images displayed. Creating events & event handlers to track how many times an image was shown, how many times an image was clicked on, and then returning all the data as a list of results. Also give the user the ability to choose how many rounds they wish to play.
- Day 2 - Prevent same images from showing up in back-to-back rounds, Providing data visualization with chart.js, reformatting the webpage to fit a given wireframe.
- Day 3 - Implement local storage / persistent data so that number of views & number of clicks are still tracked after reloading a webpage. Only saves to local storage if/when a user clicks on "view results" at the end of a survey. Added option to retake the survey (local storage persists) or reset the data (local storage is cleared).
- Day 4 - n/a
- Day 5 - Polish. Adjust CSS and implement ability for user to choose the amount of images they want to see each round. Change position of rendered chart to be where the product images used to be.
